# Development Environment Configuration

This directory contains the configuration files necessary for developing and managing the APIs and user interfaces (UI) of the project. The structure is organized to facilitate maintenance and reuse of components.

## Project Structure

- `apis/`: Directory containing the APIs and backends of the applications.
  - `health-api/`: An example of a subdirectory for a specific API, which can include source code, configuration files, Dockerfiles, etc.
  
- `ui/`: Directory designated for the user interface and any visual or static content shared between applications.
  - Examples: May contain HTML, CSS, images, or other resources used in the application's interfaces.

- `README.md`: This documentation file, explaining the structure and usage of the configurations in this directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Development environment set up with necessary tools like Node.js, Docker, etc.
- Access to the APIs and user interfaces that will be developed or maintained.

### Usage

#### Modular Directory Structure

This project is structured to be modular, with different components organized into dedicated subdirectories. This facilitates maintenance, parallel development, and code reuse.

- `apis/`: Contains backend and API code, allowing a clear separation between business logic and the user interface.
- `ui/`: Centralizes all visual and frontend elements of the applications, promoting efficient organization and easy file location.

### Customize Configurations

You can customize any of the resources by editing the corresponding files. If you need to add new APIs, backends, or UI components, create new directories or files within the existing structure and document them as necessary.

## Important Notes

- **Modularity:** Maintain modularity when adding new components, ensuring each part of the project is easily manageable.
- **Code Review:** Before adding or modifying code, review the files to ensure all specifications are correct and aligned with project requirements.
- **Best Practices:** Keep the code organized and well-documented to facilitate teamwork and future maintenance.
